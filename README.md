## Introduction
This is a solution to an existing problem in the local community of Windsor to the educational institutes. Every year there are plenty of students who apply to various universities and colleges all over the world, they face numerous difficulties in gaining information for their desired programs. As the university officials cannot be present to answer the queries 24/7, especially for the international students, bearing in mind the time difference we built a chatbot using DialogFlow that could resolve the queries any time anywhere.
